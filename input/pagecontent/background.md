### Providing Better Outcomes ###
It is becoming increasingly evident that Social Determinants (SD) are key factors in determining the well-being of an individual. They can negatively impact clinical conditions when social needs are not met. 

Numerous studies have shown the impact of SD factors. For example, a National Academy of Medicine Report stated that “Medical care is estimated to account for only 10 to 20 percent of the modifiable contributors to healthy outcomes for a population. The other 80 to 90 percent are sometimes broadly called the ‘SDoH’”. 

Significant resources are expended by non-clinical organizations to deliver social and human services to address SD needs. The work of non-clinical organizations focuses on the person or individual, their social relationships, and providing social services to improve the well-being of the individual. The FHIR standard can be enhanced to represent social constructs such as groups and relationships between individuals, which is the primary focus of this informative Companion Guide.

FHIR has proven its ability to deliver clinical applications using a patient-centric perspective. The US Department for the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Gravity Pilot Projects, and other initiatives have been developing FHIR based systems that include the capability to coordinate and manage care that also includes addressing social conditions and social service interventions. 

Whole Person Care provides a view of an individual’s clinical, behavioral, and social needs and their support network. It is becoming increasingly accepted that these needs must be addressed together to promote well-being and healthy outcomes. Enhancing the FHIR Platform to address social services enables FHIR to incorporate the specific requirements of social services and Whole Person Care into the standard.

ACF and other federal, state, and local agencies and jurisdictions are using FHIR-based systems to assist in delivering better outcomes for their populations by addressing Social Determinant (SD) factors with appropriate and qualified human and social services. These organizations have found that FHIR needs to be improved to provide complete solutions when working with individuals who need social services and with organizations that provide those social services that can improve health outcomes but are not atypical healthcare systems.

Whole Person Care is increasingly recognized as an approach for delivering better outcomes and cost-efficient solutions. The US Federal organizations such as the CDC and Health and Human Services have both strategy statements and initiatives supporting Whole Person Care. Within HHS, agencies such as CMS, SAMSHA, ACF, and the ONC all have initiatives. States such as California and Arizona have made this a strategic initiative, with California perhaps being the leader. Whole Person Care solutions from a variety of vendors are being offered including those previously focused on clinical, those primarily focused on social services, those creating new Whole Person Care coordination and case management solutions.

FHIR, as a platform for developing and delivering interoperability solutions for Whole Person Care and HL7, as a community focused on bringing participants together to deliver better outcomes, are best positioned to be the leaders in this capability. 

This Companion Guide attempts to leverage the previous work within the HL7 community, especially the work of the Gravity Project. This version of the Companion Guide is informative, intended to be an initial step to providing enhancements to FHIR to enable the goal of a FHIR System providing Whole Person Care. The FHIR Reconciliation Model is the initial step to augment and balance the need for separating the three domains required in Whole Person Care while leveraging the SDOH Clinical Care IG and being backward compatible with FHIR. 

Actions have been taken recently to deliver on the promise of providing Whole Person Care Views to deliver improved outcomes, both within and outside of the HL7 Community. The Companion Guide attempts to leverage the previous work within the HL7 community, especially the work of the Gravity Project. 

Separating concerns, as a general principle, makes software more modular. As a result it becomes more manageable, maintainable, and understandable by reducing complexity. The alternative is overloading the meaning and use of concepts.  The approach of overloading can simplify interfaces used by developers and the reuse of code. However, it does lead to ambiguity of concepts and code complexity. 

As the Whole Person Care View is an aggregated view across these different domains, developing such solutions introduces its own complexity. The goal is the FHIR Reconciliation Model enabling the HL7 community to take a leadership position in understanding that social services are different and need for it to be a first-class citizen in systems. It is critical to deliver efficient and cost effective social services to produce healthy outcomes for individuals, families, households, tribes, and larger populations while continuing to build FHIR systems that understand the causal relationships between domains.

Although beyond the scope of this informative guide, there have been patterns implemented by existing FHIR systems that can guide an infrastructure for delivering the aggregated Whole Person Care View.  An example is distributed environments where multiple patient records exist for the same individual then are consolidated to provide an aggregated, logical view of the patient across all these systems. Examples of these solutions requiring such capabilities are HIEs, QHINs, CIEs, CCHs, and complex hospital systems with localized systems. 

### The Approach
The work product is an informative Companion Guide (Guide) to the Gravity Project’s SDOH Clinical Care 2.1 Implementation Guide using the following approach.

![Methodology](backgroundApproach.png)

* Use cases were developed by Subject Matter Experts from Social Services Domains and these use cases identified the requirements for enhancements to FHIR.
* Two implementation approaches were developed from the Use Cases.
   * One implementation approach, the Gravity IG  Approach, was developed based on the SDOH Clinical Care 2.1 Implementation Guide.
   * A Social Services Domain Analysis Model was developed to provide an alternative approach using a FHIR Analysis Approach.
* Using the above two approaches, a FHIR Realization Model was developed leveraging the functional benefits provided by the Gravity IG Approach and the FHIR Analysis Approach while considering the desired evolution of FHIR as the preferred platform for implementing Whole Person Care.

### Other Considerations
**Complementing the SDOH CC IG:** To integrate and complement the SDOH CC IG, this guide's scope contains the following two actors.

1. FHIR System – A FHIR system in this Guide is a software system that is compliant with the HL7 FHIR Standard. The FHIR System provides a Whole Person Care (WPC) view. A WPC view enables any member of the care team, with appropriate authorization, to view an individual’s record that includes information across clinical, behavioral, and social domains. This record includes the ability to capture an individual’s care support team and their associations with other individuals and social groups such as family, household, religious and spiritual,  and social and work organizations. The FHIR system provides care coordination and care management functional capabilities and can interact with other systems that deliver social services.
2. Program System – A Program System in this Guide is a software system that accepts referrals from the FHIR System that can address social risks and fulfill social domain goals. Given a referral, the Program System will determine eligibility for the individual or a group the individuals (e.g., family or household) for a program, enroll the participants in the program, and specify who will receive the service, what the service is, when the service(s) are utilized, and other quantifiable properties. This data is provided to the FHIR System that was the source of the referral.
 
In the realm of social care, it's widely acknowledged that an individual's outcomes are significantly influenced by the people around them. For instance, a child with diabetes, residing in a household where one parent is gainfully employed and both parents are actively involved in her care, is likely to experience better outcomes compared to a child with a similar diagnosis living with a single parent who is facing financial struggles and battling drug addiction. In striving for improved outcomes, human services often emphasize this comprehensive understanding of a person, encompassing environmental and relational factors. 

This recognition has spurred the efforts to devise a technical framework enabling human services to delineate the role of relationships that impact individual outcomes. Roles including family dynamics, household structures, and tribal affiliations. The objective is to standardize the interpretation of relationships, ensuring that individuals seeking services outside clinical settings are accurately comprehended. By adopting this holistic perspective of individuals, we can analyze the support systems and challenges posed by these relationships, which often play pivotal roles in determining improved outcomes.
