### Financial Assistance (Tribal TANF)
Lila, a single mother of two children, Nayeli (aged 14) and Takoda (aged 10), lives on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. Lila recently lost her job at a local arts and crafts store, which had to close due to economic difficulties. The loss of her job has strained their financial situation, and Lila struggles to meet the family's basic needs.

As a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe, Lila has heard of the Tribal TANF program specifically tailored for their community's members. Lila and her children have maintained their tribal status through their participation in tribal events maintaining tribal traditions.

Upon consulting with Chief Ganka, the Tribal elder and community liaison, they are referred to Mary Rose, the community social worker. Mary uses a FHIR-based system to manage the provision of social, behavioral, clinical, and tribal services for the Oglala.

Upon consulting with a Tribal elder and community liaison, Lila learns the following:

* **Tribal Connection:** As members of a recognized tribe and residents of the reservation, Lila and her children are eligible to apply for Tribal TANF. Each state and tribe may have specific criteria regarding tribal membership or affiliation.

* **Income and Asset Considerations:** Like the standard TANF program, there are income and asset thresholds. However, given Lila's recent job loss and her limited savings, she meets the criteria.

* **Cultural Work Requirements:** While work requirements exist, the Tribal TANF program often integrates cultural and community elements. Lila can participate in local tribal cultural events, teachings, or community services to meet these requirements. This integration ensures that she stays connected with her heritage while acquiring new skills or supporting her community.

* **Support for Indigenous Practices:** Nayeli and Takoda's involvement in traditional dances and ceremonies can be considered under the program's educational and cultural enrichment activities.

* **Duration of Assistance:** Tribal TANF programs might have their own set duration for assistance, but Lila learns that she can receive support for up to 60 months. Special considerations or extensions may be provided for families facing severe hardships.

* **Customized Assistance:** Tribal TANF can offer more than just monetary aid. There could be additional support in the form of counseling, job training specific to tribal industries, and childcare services during community events.
