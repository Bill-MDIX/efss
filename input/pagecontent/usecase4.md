# Lila John - Financial Assistance (Tribal TANF)

## Brief Description

Lila, a single mother of two children, Nayeli (aged 14) and Takoda (aged 10), lives on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. Lila recently lost her job at a local arts and crafts store, which had to close due to economic difficulties. The loss of her job has strained their financial situation, and Lila struggles to meet the family's basic needs.

As a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe, Lila has heard of the Tribal TANF program specifically tailored for their community's members. Lila and her children have maintained their tribal status through their participation in tribal events maintaining tribal traditions.

Upon consulting with Chief Ganka, the Tribal elder and community liaison, they are referred to Mary Rose, the community social worker. Mary uses a FHIR-based system to manage the provision of social, behavioral, clinical, and tribal services for the Oglala.

Upon consulting with a Tribal elder and community liaison, Lila learns the following:

* **Tribal Connection:** As members of a recognized tribe and residents of the reservation, Lila and her children are eligible to apply for Tribal TANF. Each state and tribe may have specific criteria regarding tribal membership or affiliation.
* **Income and Asset Considerations:** Like the standard TANF program, there are income and asset thresholds. However, given Lila's recent job loss and her limited savings, she meets the criteria.
* **Cultural Work Requirements:** While work requirements exist, the Tribal TANF program often integrates cultural and community elements. Lila can participate in local tribal cultural events, teachings, or community services to meet these requirements. This integration ensures that she stays connected with her heritage while acquiring new skills or supporting her community.
* **Support for Indigenous Practices:** Nayeli and Takoda's involvement in traditional dances and ceremonies can be considered under the program's educational and cultural enrichment activities.
* **Duration of Assistance:** Tribal TANF programs might have their own set duration for assistance, but Lila learns that she can receive support for up to 60 months. Special considerations or extensions may be provided for families facing severe hardships.
* **Customized Assistance:** Tribal TANF can offer more than just monetary aid. There could be additional support in the form of counseling, job training specific to tribal industries, and childcare services during community events.

### TANF Tribal Eligibility Rules:
The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is a U.S. federal assistance program. While the program is federally funded, each state administers its own TANF program, establishes its own eligibility criteria, and determines the type and amount of assistance payments.

**As a result, the specific requirements can vary from state to state.**  However, there are general eligibility requirements that apply across states.  Tribal TANF is a version of the federal TANF program that allows American Indian and Alaskan Native tribes to run their own TANF programs to best serve their communities' unique needs.

**The requirements and benefits for Tribal TANF can differ from regular TANF programs because tribes can set their own guidelines.**

* **Income Limits:**
   * Applicants must have a low or very low income.
   * Each state has its own set income thresholds based on family size.
   * Both earned (like wages) and unearned (like unemployment benefits) income are considered.
* **Asset Limits:** Some states set asset limits, such as the value of vehicles, bank account balances, or properties, excluding the applicant's primary home.
* **S. Citizenship or Eligible Non-Citizen Status:**
   * Applicants must be U.S. citizens or specific categories of eligible non-citizens, such as lawful permanent residents.
   * Non-citizens might have a waiting period before they can apply.
* **Children in Household:**
   * TANF is primarily for families with children under 18.
   * The child might be required to live in the home of a parent or a close relative.
   * In some states, pregnant women in their last trimester can also qualify.
* **Cooperation with Child Support Services:** If a parent applies for TANF benefits for a child but is not cooperating with child support services to obtain support from the other parent, they might be disqualified.
* **Work Requirements:**
   * Adults must participate in work or training activities for a certain number of hours per week, unless they are exempt (e.g., due to being pregnant or having a young child).
   * States have flexibility in defining these activities, which can include actual employment, job search, community service, or vocational training.
* **Time Limits:**
   * Families can receive TANF for a maximum of 60 months (5 years) in their lifetime, although some states have shorter limits.
   * States can exempt up to 20% of their caseload from this limit if they face hardships.
* **Social Security Number: Applicants are required to provide or apply for a Social Security Number (SSN) for each member of the family seeking assistance.
* **Immunization Requirements:** Some states require that children be immunized to be eligible.
* **School Attendance:** School-age children in the family must be attending school, and states can require teens without a high school diploma or GED to attend training or education as a condition of receiving TANF.
* **Drug Testing:** Some states require applicants to undergo drug testing.
* **Residency:** Applicants must be residents of the state where they are applying.

_Again, it's crucial to understand that specific eligibility criteria and requirements vary significantly from each state or tribe._

_Those interested in TANF should check their state's guidelines or consult with a local/tribal social services office._

## Example for Determining Eligibility Amount:
1. **Determine Gross Income:** Calculate the total annual gross income of the household.
2. **Apply Deductions:** Subtract the standard deduction, child deduction, and earnings deduction from the gross income to get the net income.
3. **Compare with the Poverty Line:** Compare the net income with the poverty line for the household size. If the net income is below the poverty line, move to the next step.
4. **Check Assets:** Calculate the total value of the assets. If they're below the designated limit, move to the next step.
5. **Consider Other Criteria:** Ensure the household meets the other criteria, such as residency, tribal membership, and age requirements.
6. **Determine Benefit Amount:** Based on the household size, net income, and other considerations, determine the TANF benefit amount the family is eligible for.

_By following these steps, TANF caseworkers can efficiently determine the eligibility and benefit amount for each applicant._
